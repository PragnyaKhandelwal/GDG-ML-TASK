# GDG-ML-TASK

## About

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project that leverages the Solar Power Generation Dataset from Kaggle to analyze, model, and predict solar power output. The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook and focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the evaluation of various regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. The key objective is to identify the best-performing model based on multiple accuracy metrics and utilize it for predicting solar power generation for subsequent days.

The solution demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, model training, evaluation with multiple metrics (MAE, RMSE, RÂ²), and future predictions. This project is designed for clarity, reproducibility, and practical insights in renewable energy forecasting.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [Solar Power Generation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data) available publicly on Kaggle. It contains weather sensor data and power generation data for multiple plants, aggregated with timestamps.

## Project Structure

- `Solar_Power_Generation_Notebook.ipynb`: The main Google Colab notebook containing all code, exploratory data analysis, model comparisons, and predictions.
- `archive/`: Folder containing the weather and generation CSV files (if included) or links to download.
- `README.md`: Documentation and explanation of the project.

## Key Features

- Data merging and cleaning of weather and generation datasets per plant.
- Comprehensive EDA with statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlation analysis.
- Multiple regression algorithms applied and evaluated.
- Clear presentation of model performance metrics.
- Final predictions with the best-performing model for next-day solar power output.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
3. Mount Google Drive or place the `archive` folder with data in the working directory.
4. Run through the notebook cells sequentially.
5. Analyze the results and modify features or models as needed.
